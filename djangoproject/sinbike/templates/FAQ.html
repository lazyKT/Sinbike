                            As the parking QR codes are heavily utilised, and some being exposed to weather conditions, <br>
                            there is a possibility that some of the parking QR codes are damaged or removed due to foul play / vandalism. <br>
                            Note: Do ensure that you are at a designated parking area (’P’ icon on our app), not all yellow boxes in Singapore are designated parking areas. <br>
                            Kindly assist us by ending your trip and park the bicycle in the designated parking area.  <br>
                            when prompted to scan the parking QR code. Submit your appeal with a clear photo of the bicycle parked in the designated parking area. <br>
                            In any instance that you are unable to send an appeal via our app, you can send us your appeal at “Help Centre ” <br>
